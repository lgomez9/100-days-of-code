# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 0: January 3, 2020
##### Prologue

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the GitHub, getting comfortable with the rules and gimmick of 100 days of code.

**Thoughts**: I get into my own head when it comes to stuff like GitHub, which I'm only vaguely unfamiliar with, and it stops me from committing full force. I can make mistakes! I can do this!

**Link to work**: Not today, but definitely tomorrow!

### Day 1: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the first two problems of Project Euler. Pretty simple to solve, just slight twists on problems that I've seen before. I also finished up the JavaScript: Arrays section (section 13) for Cole Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: This was a good start to the program. Definitely will get more complicated as we keep going (the first two problems of Project Euler only have a 5% difficulty), but mostly felt good to be productive in two different ways today.

**Link(s) to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 2: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the third and fourth problem of Project Euler. Required a little more thinking than the first two for sure, but still ultimately ended up being pretty simple problems. A good warm-up for what I'm sure is only going to get harder. I also finished up the JavaScript: Objects section (section 14) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: This was a good second day, especially before work starts back up. Feels good to be productive in two different ways today. Only stopping today because I have other work to do, otherwise I'm really excited to keep going with this Udemy course. Going to have to eventually work on a project that incorporates the HTML, CSS, and JS I've been learning.

**Link to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 3: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the fifth and sixth problem of Project Euler. Problem 5 required a couple of functions, while problem 6 was pretty simple. Maybe there's a more efficient way to do it that I'm missing, but it was pretty straightforward, and the challenge seems to have more to do with understanding how to program than understanding the math. I'm going to keep going with Project Euler at least until the end of the week, before maybe slowing down to only a problem a day instead of 2. Also finished the DOM Manipulation section (section 15) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Progress has been pretty good so far. I think the Colt Steele class is going to become slightly more project-based now that we've finished the JavaScript portion, which I'm very excited for.

**Link to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 4: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the seventh and eighth problem of Project Euler. I wasn't super satisfied with my solutions, but I found the right answer, which at this point I'll take. I might do some independent research to see if I can find more efficient solutions. Also finished the Advanced DOM Manipulation section (section 16) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Progress is definitely going to slow down now that school has started. Even today, I know that I'll have less time to get this stuff down when school really gets underway.

**Link to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 5: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forgot to update this the day of! I did the 9th and 10th problems of Project Euler. Again, probably inefficient solutions, but I can go back and try to fix them later! Started like the very first section of Colt Steele's Section 17, but didn't have as much time as I would've liked to get into it.

**Thoughts**: Progress definitely slowed down today now that school has really started.

**Link to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 6: January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the 11th and 12th problems of Project Euler. I continued maybe one section of Colt Steele's Section 17, but again, it's becoming much harder to commit time now that school has started up again.

**Thoughts**: Progress has definitively slowed down. Might need to rethink how I'm organizing my day to make sure I have time to get this done every day.

**Link to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 7: January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going back to fill this out now. On Friday I just had time to do problem 13 for Project Euler. I looked at 14, and my solution took too long to get an actual answer. Part of the fun of these problems is definitely realizing that what seems like a pretty simple solution is actually intractable and needs to be rethought. I had an idea for it yesterday (1/11), but didn't have the opportunity to try coding it. 

**Thoughts**: Fridays are going to be the hardest days to get done, because I'll usually be going straight to a happy hour or to hang out with friends after school. If I can make sure I just do a little bit during my planning periods, I shouldn't have that much trouble, but they'll definitely be my least productive days.

**Link to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 8: January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do any Project Euler today, but I did do all of section 17 of Colt Steele's Web Develompent Bootcamp. The color game project is in this repository. Eventually going to have to add my own personal projects.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have the chance to work on Project Euler today, and I felt bad about that, but it did feel really good to do a project that involved JS, CSS, and HTML all working together.

**Link to work**: Found in the Web Development Bootcamp folder in this repository.

### Day 9: January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished problem 14. Might take a look at and try to finish problem 15 too. My big problem is not accounting for overflow. My program was getting stuck because it would overflow, and switching my ints to long solved that problem immediately. I also got through the Intro to jQuery and Advanced jQuery sections on Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp!

**Thoughts**: This has happened multiple times to me, and I'm annoyed I didn't think about the overflow problem earlier. Need to start defaulting to longs for these problems.

**Link to work**: Found in the Web Development Bootcamp folder in this repository.

### Day 10: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: We've come a 10th of the way through this challenge, and progress has definitely slowed. It's pretty difficult to find time for this at the moment, but I'm doing my best to find a half hour here and there. I just managed to finish problem 15 of Project Euler today, but not sure when my next best chance to look at challenge 16 is going to be.

**Thoughts**: Not having time to do anything after work sucks.

**Link to work**: In Project Euler folder in this repository

### Day 11: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have time to do much today. I have a coding interview coming up, so figured that I should hop back on Leetcode. Finished the problems in not too too long, and think I found pretty optimal solutions.

**Thoughts**: Getting back into Leetcode felt good. Definitely need to brush up on my coding question skills before I take the Codility test.

**Link to work**: In Leetcode folder in this repository (1295, 1299).

### Day 12: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Managed to find much more time today to get down to business. I did a couple more problems on Leetcode, finished another Project Euler problem, and then got started on the next section of Colt Steele's Web Development course.

**Thoughts**: Today was a great day, after a couple of days that I was feeling a little down about my lack of progress. I definitely need to get a little more productive when it comes to Project Euler, but the fact that I'm still at a better than a problem a day pace means I think I'm on the right track. A little worried about what this weekend will do to my progress.

**Link to work**: In Project Euler and Leetcode folder in this repository (1281, 1287).

### Day 13: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I managed to do a lot today! Having more time yesterday to lesson plan really helped me put my pedal to the metal. I managed to finish two Project Euler problems, two Leetcode problems, and then also managed to finish another section of the Web Development course. 

**Thoughts**: Today was a really good day, and it felt good to string two together before I have Sydney visiting and will have significantly less time for my shenanigans. Progress is going to be really slow the next couple of days, but I'll be back with a vengeance next Tuesday.

**Link to work**: All in the Leetcode, Project Euler, and Web Development Course folder in this repository.

### Day 14: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of time to do things today, and just managed to finish another Leetcode problem and get started on the first two parts of the next section of the Web Development course.

**Thoughts**: Today was a slow day, as was expected!

**Link to work**: In the Leetcode folder in this repository.

### Day 15: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did a decent amount today, including another two problems of Project Euler, and two Leetcode problems, including one medium problem!

**Thoughts**: Today was a good day, and I'm still at a better than a problem a day rate for Project Euler!

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler and Leetcode folders in this repository. 

### Day 16: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did another problem of Project Euler.

**Thoughts**: This weekend has been fantastic, but back on the grind starting on Tuesday!

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 17: January 20, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked through another problem on Project Euler, finished another section of the Web Development Course, and finished a Leetcode problem.

**Thoughts**: This was a good day of work, although I definitely need to start making sure I get the optimal solutions when I solve these problems. Looking at other people's solutions on the Leetcode problem afterwards made me realize how inefficiently I'd been thinking.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler and Leetcode folders in this repository.

### Day 18: January 21, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Just had time to look at problem 23 for Project Euler. A little disappointed to not have time to finish it, especially given that I believe I'm missing something small to solve it.

**Thoughts**: None really today! Hoping to get more time to work tomorrow!

**Link to work**: Not uploaded cause still haven't found the solution!

### Day 19: January 22, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Figured out the error for problem 23, and it had to do with how I was finding the divisorSum. I eventually found out what was necessary from some snooping on Stack Overflow, and I'm glad it didn't take longer to figure it out, as it was starting to drive me a little crazy. Also got started on the next section of the Web Development course!

**Thoughts**: Took a quick peek at problem 24 for Project Euler, although I didn't even start thinking about a solution. Looks like it's going to be a tough one, and I'm glad I'm still at a problem a day pace, although I might see that slow down soon. Also excited to get down to some backend development in the Web Development course!

**Link to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder of this repository.

### Day 20: January 23, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished problem 24 and 25 of Project Euler, and managed to do two more sections of the web development course!

**Thoughts**: Problem 24 was difficult, and I had to do some sleuthing for algorithms to use. I felt bad, as this is definitely the problem that I relied the most on outside help for. Problem 25 was pretty simple using Big Integers, but I think I'm going to have to back through and refactor some of my solutions, cause I figure all the ones with BigIntegers can probably be refactored.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder of this repository.

### Day 21: January 24, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent a little bit of time looking at problem 26, but honestly not that long. Did a couple of problems in Leetcode, and then also went through a tiny little bit of a personal project.

**Thoughts**: Problem 26 is going to be a toughie, and I think that I'm going to be surprised by how much more difficult the next 25 are then the first 25. 

**Link to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 22: January 25, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not much progress today, but I did learn a little more about how to solve problem 26!

**Thoughts**: Learning about the Euler totient function for problem 26 was actually really interesting, and I'm excited about learning new math as we go along in these challenges.

**Link to work**: Purely conceptual today! Some light coding.

### Day 23: January 26, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a decent amount of progress today. Didn't work on Project Euler today, but did manage to finish another section of Colt Steele's Web Development course, and did a leetcode problem, a medium problem this time!

**Thoughts**: Definitely didn't have the most mentally taxing day today, but enjoyed working on the Node.js material. I also enjoy using the command line, it truly is a remarkably useful tool, one that I don't think I truly appreciated while I was getting beaten down by 323.

**Link to work**: In the Leetcode folder in this repository.

### Day 24: January 27, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Today was a very productive day. I finished the next Project Euler problem, although I'm starting to slow down and lose my problem a day steam, I did another section of the Web Development course, and most importantly, I finally finished the Codility test.

**Thoughts**: Getting the Codility test for Genospace down was a big win for the program, and although my anxiety was really acting up, I managed to stay calm and get it finished. I'm feeling good and ready for tomorrow!

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 25: January 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I finished a Leetcode problem, and got started on a personal TicTacToe project that I'll try to finish this weekend.

**Thoughts**: Working on the TicTacToe problem has really helped me understand how important practice is to the knowledge I've gained. I definitely know more about CSS, HTML, and JS than I started out, but I definitely have to practice by doing some projects to make sure that I internalize the knowledge that I've gained.

**Link to work**: In the Leetcode folder in this repository.

### Day 26: January 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did another two problems for Project Euler, and finished another section of the Web Development course.

**Thoughts**: Getting another two problems done for Project Euler felt good, and finishing another section of the Web Development course also feels great. Excited to get into some projects for the web development course.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 27: January 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did another two problems for Leetcode, one easy and one medium.

**Thoughts**: Medium problems can be deceptively easy - I think what makes them "medium" is usually the application of some advanced DS (usually trees), that can be confusing for people not comfortable with data structures. Not to say I always have the easiest time with trees, cause I definitely don't.

**Link to work**: In the Leetcode folder in this repository.

### Day 28: January 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did another two problems for Project Euler, did another Leetcode problem, medium.

**Thoughts**: Same thoughts as yesterday. Project Euler is definitely getting harder, although I've been able to figure them out which is good.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler and Leetcode folders in this repository.

### Day 29: February 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did another Project Euler problem, and did another section of the Web Development course!

**Thoughts**: Feeling good about my progress so far, but think I might have to run back through some DS stuff in the next couple weeks.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 30: February 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did another two problems of Project Euler (33 and 34). Didn't have the time to do anything else super productive.

**Thoughts**: I'm definitely going to have to go back through my solution to Project Euler and refactor them after the fact.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 31: February 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did another two problems of Project Euler (35 and 36). Didn't have the time to do too much moer.

**Thoughts**: Honestly, I feel like I've slowed down a little bit, but I'm proud of myself for making it nearly a third of the way through with some pretty consistent progress. Getting back to two problems of Project Euler a day feels like a pretty good streak to be on, although I'm sure that I'll slow down again. At the very least, it's given me a little wiggle room when it comes to trying to maintain a problem a day average.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 32: February 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did another two Leetcode problems!

**Thoughts**: Today was another slowish day because of my interview. Back on the grind tomorrow!

**Link to work**: In the Leetcode folder in this repository.

### Day 33: February 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did another couple of Leetcode problems.

**Thoughts**: Slow day because of TNTP and my meeting after school. Tomorrow I will officially be back on that grind!! Found a really cool interview preparation course on Leetcode - I haven't explored enough of the site, but it definitely looks worth checking out.

**Link to work**: On Leetcode profile.

### Day 34: February 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did two more Project Euler problems, did another few of the Leetcode Interview Preparation module, and put some more work into my personal Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts**: A productive day after two pretty slow days!! Getting more Project Euler done felt great, and the Leetcode problems are always great practice, even the ones that I've seen before are great to just keep my skills sharp. Working on my Tic Tac Toe project feels great, just in that it's good to have some experience trying to code my own JS, HTML, and CSS.

**Link to work**: In Project Euler and Tic Tac Toe folders in this repository.

### Day 35: February 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did two more Project Euler problems, did some more work on the Tic Tac Toe project.

**Thoughts**: A productive(ish) day! Getting another two Project Euler problems always feels good. Working on the Tic Tac Toe project also just makes me feel very good, as I'm having fun exploring and working with jQuery.

**Link to work**: In Project Euler and Tic Tac Toe folders in this repository.

### Day 36: February 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Just did another section of the Web Development course, getting started on the capstone YelpCamp project.

**Thoughts**: Festival season is definitely going to tank my productivity, but it's hard to complain about that when I'm having so much fun! As long as I keep decent progress on Project Euler and the Web Development course, I think I can afford slower days!

**Link to work**: On Goorm

### Day 37: February 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another two problems of Project Euler down!

**Thoughts**: Another relatively slow day, which I'm not super happy about, but I had a great day besides that, so all's well that ends well.

**Link to work**: In Project Euler folder of this repository.

### Day 38: February 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another couple of problems of Leetcode's interview preparation kit.

**Thoughts**: I'm definitely going to have to take some time this weekend on these interview preparation questions, some of them are good thinkers.

**Link to work**: On my Leetcode account. 

### Day 39: February 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another slow day of some Leetcode interview preparation.

**Thoughts**: Definitely going to need to zero in on the problems that give me the most difficulty (Trees)

**Link to work**: On my Leetcode account.

### Day 40: February 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got started on another section of the Web Development course.

**Thoughts**: Slow progress yet again.

**Link to work**: N/A

### Day 41: February 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Another slow day of Leetcode problems.

**Thoughts**: Nothing much to report, definitely not spending my time as efficiently as I can.

**Link to work**: On my Leetcode account.

### Day 42: February 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finally took advantage of a free day to really put some work in. I finished another section of the Web Development course, and did 3 problems of Project Euler.

**Thoughts**: Feels good to be back at Project Euler, even though it took me a while to get back to it. I can taste halfway!

**Link to work**: In Project Euler folder of this repository.

### Day 43: February 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Just did a few more Leetcode problems. They're a good way to get some coding in on the days that I'm especially busy. 

**Thoughts**: Definitely need to get more work done on Project Euler done tomorrow.

**Link to work**: On my Leetcode folder.

### Day 44: February 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Had a very productive day! Did two more Project Euler problems, did another section of the Web Development course, and did a couple more Leetcode problems.

**Thoughts**: Had a productive day, after a pretty meh week, besides Friday. Felt good to be productive, and looking forward to hopefully having a very balanced week this week between productivity and fun.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 45-50: February 17-21, 2020

A couple of days of doing Leetcode, Project Euler, and the Web Development course! Finished halfway through Project Euler 100, but still have plenty of work to do to finish it up.

### Day 51: Mar 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Started working on redoing the RESTful Routes project, but this time, instead of dogs, I've remade it so that it's a log of all the books that I've read so far this year. I'm going to keep updating it throughout the year, and it'll be my official book tab!

**Thoughts**: Actually really enjoying this project because it has some personal significance. Been a lot easier to think up of some new features that I'd actually want to see added! Going to eventually add movies to this too, so that I can also keep track of that information super easily.

**Link to work**: On Goorm, going to translate it to Github.

### Day 52: Mar 2, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on some Leetcode.

**Thoughts**: Didn't do enough!

**Link to work**: On Leetcode

### Day 53: Mar 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on the Book Blog!

**Thoughts**: It's fun to have a project that I actually have some vested interested in!

**Link to work**: On Goorm.

### Day 54: Mar 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on two more Project Euler problems, and did another section of the Web Development course (through Authentication).

**Thoughts**: I committed a cardinal sin here, skipping a Project Euler problem, but problem 51 is going to require some real thinking and time, and I wanted to get something done, so I'm hoping that I can be forgiven. I do see that the backhalf of the 100 problems have a lot of more difficult problems, so we'll see how long it takes me to finish up. I'm determined to finish the Web Development course sooner rather than later, and I hope that I can be done by the end of the week.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder of this repository.

### Day 55: Mar 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Worked on another section of the Web Development Course.

**Thoughts**: I'm so close to being finished with the course, I can taste it!

**Link to work**: On Goorm.

### Day 56, 57: Mar 28, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did some more of the Web Development Course, and worked on a personal implementation of a Pomodoro Timer!

**Thoughts**: I need to go into the day with a clearer picture of what I want to be doing day-to-day. Maybe one day I don't look at Project Euler, and instead just focus on the Web Development course, but I have too much time in quaratine to be doing as little coding as I have been doing. Also, I completely messed up my 100 days of code! As long as I finish 100 I'm not going to beat myself up too badly, even though I really should restart at 1.

**Link to work**: On Goorm, and in the Pomodoro folder in this repository.

### Day 58: Mar 29, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished another section of the Web Development course, and worked on the CSS of my Pomodoro timer.

**Thoughts**: Today was a pretty productive day. Tomorrow, I think I'm going to look at Project Euler, cause while the stuff I've been doing has been interesting, it hasn't been particularly difficult, and I want to do something that's going to make me think.

**Link to work**: On Goorm, and in the Pomodor folder in this repository.

### Day 59: Mar 30, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished another section of the Web Development course. Only three sections left till we're done!

**Thoughts**: Exciting to be done with something that I've been working on for so long!

**Link to work**: On Goorm.

### Day 60: Mar 31, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished another section of the Web Development course. Also started challenge 54 of the Project Euler challenge.

**Thoughts**: Getting back on to Project Euler was great, it's a lot of brain exercise.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder of this repository.

### Day 61: Apr 1, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Just finished up problem 54 for Project Euler.

**Thoughts**: It felt really good to get something as involved as problem 54 is done. I had to create a couple different classes, really think about the functions that were required, and then just think through the logic of comparing two poker hands. I think that if I have time, it's worth going back to refactor, as I already have a sneaking suspicion that some of my code might be a little redundant, but the fact that it worked the first time I tested it out without a problem is a huge boost.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder of this repository.

### Day 62: April 2, 2020

**Today's Progress** Got started on another section of the Web Development course and got started on problem 55 for Project Euler.

**Thoughts**: I can't believe I'm almost done with the Web Development course! Really feel accomplished, considering I think I started it in November or December. Definitely going to need to take some time to practice the web development skills I've gained.

**Link to work**: On Goorm.

### Day 63: April 3, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Put some more work in the book blog app!

**Thoughts**: This is really starting to take shape. Today, I switched up the layout of the site, so that instead of the books being listed in one column, they're listed in rows of 4. I also changed it up so that they no longer have their titles, authors, or anything else listed, besides the book cover. Added a new background image too, and changed it to give it a little more of a feel for when you're hovering over a book cover.

**Link to work**: On Goorm.

### Day 64: April 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished another section of the Web Development course, and did another problem of Project Euler.

**Thoughts**: It feels good to be getting back into the Project Euler groove, and I can't believe that I have just one section of the Web Development course left before I'm done. Definitely need to polish those skills, but I'm excited to then move onto the Swift course.

**Link to work**: On Goorm and in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 65: April 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished another Project Euler problem and put more work in on the Book Blog.

**Thoughts**: Feels good to be in a groove again with Project Euler, although I know I have problem 51 looming. A little annoyed I can't figure out what the issue is with the Book Blog and individual book's quotes, but I'm sure I'll figure it out eventually.

**Link to work**: On Goorm and in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 66: April 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finish the Web Development Bootcamp on Udemy!

**Thoughts**: It was such a long time ago that I started the Web Development Bootcamp, and I think that I have to really appreciate that. I've been steadily working at it for a few months, and it feels like a great accomplishment to have it all done. On to the next! Going to work on the iOS course I bought next, but I'm going to have to make sure I revisit the concepts I learned in the Web Development Bootcamp on my own time, and with my own personal projects!

**Link to work**: Not in this repository - it was mostly small JS stuff. 

### Day 67: April 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Spent some time trying to figure out the quotes feature for the Book Blog. Was not successful, turned to Stack Overflow. Will give it another try in a few days.

**Thoughts**: This is really frustrating me, and the errors that I'm getting are not helping, at least not in the way I need.

**Link to work**: On Goorm.


### Day 68: April 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got started on another Project Euler problem (58) and got started on the iOS App Development Course!

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to get into another course, but I need to make sure that I don't let the knowledge that I've gained from the web development course go to waste. I need to make sure I'm keeping a healthy balance between applying those skills that I've gained, and learning new skills.

**Link to work**: Nothing on this git repository.


### Day 69: April 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished the Project Euler problem from yesterday (58) and finished a section of the iOS App Development Course.

**Thoughts**: I need to be putting a more concerted effort into finishing these Project Euler problems.

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler folder of this repository.


### Day 70: April 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Got started on another Project Euler problem, did more of the iOS App Development course, and started implementing some data structures for practice, based on William Fiset's course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Getting back into data structures, and spending more time dissecting them for understanding, I think will prove to be a really fruitful avenue of research.

**Link to work**: In the DS folder of this repository. 

### Day 71: April 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Re-learned about and implemented a Union Find, and worked more on the Tic Tac Toe application I had made. Functionally, it 99% works the exact way I want it to, and most of the work left to be done is aesthetic, not functional.

**Thoughts**: I don't know what changed about today, but we finally got the Tic Tac Toe to work exactly the way I wanted it to. Still need to put some work into it, aesthetically and a little functionally, but honestly I wish I hadn't been so lazy before and had just gotten it done.

**Link to work**: In my own private personal projects folder.
