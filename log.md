# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 0: January 3, 2020
##### Prologue

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the GitHub, getting comfortable with the rules and gimmick of 100 days of code.

**Thoughts**: I get into my own head when it comes to stuff like GitHub, which I'm only vaguely unfamiliar with, and it stops me from committing full force. I can make mistakes! I can do this!

**Link to work**: Not today, but definitely tomorrow!

### Day 1: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the first two problems of Project Euler. Pretty simple to solve, just slight twists on problems that I've seen before. I also finished up the JavaScript: Arrays section (section 13) for Cole Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: This was a good start to the program. Definitely will get more complicated as we keep going (the first two problems of Project Euler only have a 5% difficulty), but mostly felt good to be productive in two different ways today.

### Day 2: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the third and fourth problem of Project Euler. Required a little more thinking than the first two for sure, but still ultimately ended up being pretty simple problems. A good warm-up for what I'm sure is only going to get harder. I also finished up the JavaScript: Objects section (section 14) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: This was a good second day, especially before work starts back up. Feels good to be productive in two different ways today. Only stopping today because I have other work to do, otherwise I'm really excited to keep going with this Udemy course. Going to have to eventually work on a project that incorporates the HTML, CSS, and JS I've been learning.

### Day 3: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the fifth and sixth problem of Project Euler. Problem 5 required a couple of functions, while problem 6 was pretty simple. Maybe there's a more efficient way to do it that I'm missing, but it was pretty straightforward, and the challenge seems to have more to do with understanding how to program than understanding the math. I'm going to keep going with Project Euler at least until the end of the week, before maybe slowing down to only a problem a day instead of 2. Also finished the DOM Manipulation section (section 15) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Progress has been pretty good so far. I think the Colt Steele class is going to become slightly more project-based now that we've finished the JavaScript portion, which I'm very excited for.

### Day 4: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the seventh and eighth problem of Project Euler. I wasn't super satisfied with my solutions, but I found the right answer, which at this point I'll take. I might do some independent research to see if I can find more efficient solutions. Also finished the Advanced DOM Manipulation section (section 16) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Progress is definitely going to slow down now that school has started. Even today, I know that I'll have less time to get this stuff down when school really gets underway.

### Day 5: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forgot to update this the day of! I did the 9th and 10th problems of Project Euler. Again, probably inefficient solutions, but I can go back and try to fix them later! Started like the very first section of Colt Steele's Section 17, but didn't have as much time as I would've liked to get into it.

**Thoughts**: Progress definitely slowed down today now that school has really started.

### Day 6: January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the 11th and 12th problems of Project Euler. I continued maybe one section of Colt Steele's Section 17, but again, it's becoming much harder to commit time now that school has started up again.

**Thoughts**: Progress has definitively slowed down. Might need to rethink how I'm organizing my day to make sure I have time to get this done every day.

### Day 7: January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going back to fill this out now. On Friday I just had time to do problem 13 for Project Euler. I looked at 14, and my solution took too long to get an actual answer. Part of the fun of these problems is definitely realizing that what seems like a pretty simple solution is actually intractable and needs to be rethought. I had an idea for it yesterday (1/11), but didn't have the opportunity to try coding it. 

**Thoughts**: Fridays are going to be the hardest days to get done, because I'll usually be going straight to a happy hour or to hang out with friends after school. If I can make sure I just do a little bit during my planning periods, I shouldn't have that much trouble, but they'll definitely be my least productive days.

### Day 8: January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do any Project Euler today, but I did do all of section 17 of Colt Steele's Web Develompent Bootcamp. The color game project is in this repository. Eventually going to have to add my own personal projects.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have the chance to work on Project Euler today, and I felt bad about that, but it did feel really good to do a project that involved JS, CSS, and HTML all working together.

### Day 9: January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished problem 14. Might take a look at and try to finish problem 15 too. My big problem is not accounting for overflow. My program was getting stuck because it would overflow, and switching my ints to long solved that problem immediately. I also got through the Intro to jQuery and Advanced jQuery sections on Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp!

**Thoughts**: This has happened multiple times to me, and I'm annoyed I didn't think about the overflow problem earlier. Need to start defaulting to longs for these problems.
