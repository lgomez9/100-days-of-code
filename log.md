# 100 Days Of Code - Log (Round 1)

### Day 0: January 3, 2020
##### Prologue

**Today's Progress**: Setting up the GitHub, getting comfortable with the rules and gimmick of 100 days of code.

**Thoughts**: I get into my own head when it comes to stuff like GitHub, which I'm only vaguely unfamiliar with, and it stops me from committing full force. I can make mistakes! I can do this!

**Link to work**: Not today, but definitely tomorrow!

### Day 1: January 4, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the first two problems of Project Euler. Pretty simple to solve, just slight twists on problems that I've seen before. I also finished up the JavaScript: Arrays section (section 13) for Cole Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: This was a good start to the program. Definitely will get more complicated as we keep going (the first two problems of Project Euler only have a 5% difficulty), but mostly felt good to be productive in two different ways today.

### Day 2: January 5, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the third and fourth problem of Project Euler. Required a little more thinking than the first two for sure, but still ultimately ended up being pretty simple problems. A good warm-up for what I'm sure is only going to get harder. I also finished up the JavaScript: Objects section (section 14) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: This was a good second day, especially before work starts back up. Feels good to be productive in two different ways today. Only stopping today because I have other work to do, otherwise I'm really excited to keep going with this Udemy course. Going to have to eventually work on a project that incorporates the HTML, CSS, and JS I've been learning.

### Day 3: January 6, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the fifth and sixth problem of Project Euler. Problem 5 required a couple of functions, while problem 6 was pretty simple. Maybe there's a more efficient way to do it that I'm missing, but it was pretty straightforward, and the challenge seems to have more to do with understanding how to program than understanding the math. I'm going to keep going with Project Euler at least until the end of the week, before maybe slowing down to only a problem a day instead of 2. Also finished the DOM Manipulation section (section 15) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Progress has been pretty good so far. I think the Colt Steele class is going to become slightly more project-based now that we've finished the JavaScript portion, which I'm very excited for.

### Day 4: January 7, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the seventh and eighth problem of Project Euler. I wasn't super satisfied with my solutions, but I found the right answer, which at this point I'll take. I might do some independent research to see if I can find more efficient solutions. Also finished the Advanced DOM Manipulation section (section 16) for Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy.

**Thoughts**: Progress is definitely going to slow down now that school has started. Even today, I know that I'll have less time to get this stuff down when school really gets underway.

### Day 5: January 8, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Forgot to update this the day of! I did the 9th and 10th problems of Project Euler. Again, probably inefficient solutions, but I can go back and try to fix them later! Started like the very first section of Colt Steele's Section 17, but didn't have as much time as I would've liked to get into it.

**Thoughts**: Progress definitely slowed down today now that school has really started.

**Link to work**: Found in the Project Euler folder in this repository.

### Day 6: January 9, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I did the 11th and 12th problems of Project Euler. I continued maybe one section of Colt Steele's Section 17, but again, it's becoming much harder to commit time now that school has started up again.

**Thoughts**: Progress has definitively slowed down. Might need to rethink how I'm organizing my day to make sure I have time to get this done every day.

### Day 7: January 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Going back to fill this out now. On Friday I just had time to do problem 13 for Project Euler. I looked at 14, and my solution took too long to get an actual answer. Part of the fun of these problems is definitely realizing that what seems like a pretty simple solution is actually intractable and needs to be rethought. I had an idea for it yesterday (1/11), but didn't have the opportunity to try coding it. 

**Thoughts**: Fridays are going to be the hardest days to get done, because I'll usually be going straight to a happy hour or to hang out with friends after school. If I can make sure I just do a little bit during my planning periods, I shouldn't have that much trouble, but they'll definitely be my least productive days.

### Day 8: January 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I didn't do any Project Euler today, but I did do all of section 17 of Colt Steele's Web Develompent Bootcamp. The color game project is in this repository. Eventually going to have to add my own personal projects.

**Thoughts**: Didn't have the chance to work on Project Euler today, and I felt bad about that, but it did feel really good to do a project that involved JS, CSS, and HTML all working together.

### Day 9: January 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Finished problem 14. Might take a look at and try to finish problem 15 too. My big problem is not accounting for overflow. My program was getting stuck because it would overflow, and switching my ints to long solved that problem immediately. I also got through the Intro to jQuery and Advanced jQuery sections on Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp!

**Thoughts**: This has happened multiple times to me, and I'm annoyed I didn't think about the overflow problem earlier. Need to start defaulting to longs for these problems.

### Day 10: January 13, 2020

**Today's Progress**: We've come a 10th of the way through this challenge, and progress has definitely slowed. It's pretty difficult to find time for this at the moment, but I'm doing my best to find a half hour here and there. I just managed to finish problem 15 of Project Euler today, but not sure when my next best chance to look at challenge 16 is going to be.

**Thoughts**: Not having time to do anything after work sucks.

### Day 11: January 14, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Didn't have time to do much today. I have a coding interview coming up, so figured that I should hop back on Leetcode. Finished the problems in not too too long, and think I found pretty optimal solutions.

**Thoughts**: Getting back into Leetcode felt good. Definitely need to brush up on my coding question skills before I take the Codility test.

**Link to work**: In Leetcode folder in this repository (1295, 1299).

### Day 12: January 15, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Managed to find much more time today to get down to business. I did a couple more problems on Leetcode, finished another Project Euler problem, and then got started on the next section of Colt Steele's Web Development course.

**Thoughts**: Today was a great day, after a couple of days that I was feeling a little down about my lack of progress. I definitely need to get a little more productive when it comes to Project Euler, but the fact that I'm still at a better than a problem a day pace means I think I'm on the right track. A little worried about what this weekend will do to my progress.

### Day 13: January 16, 2020

**Today's Progress**: I managed to do a lot today! Having more time yesterday to lesson plan really helped me put my pedal to the metal. I managed to finish two Project Euler problems, two Leetcode problems, and then also managed to finish another section of the Web Development course. 

**Thoughts**: Today was a really good day, and it felt good to string two together before I have Sydney visiting and will have significantly less time for my shenanigans. Progress is going to be really slow the next couple of days, but I'll be back with a vengeance next Tuesday.

**Link to work**: All in the Leetcode, Project Euler, and Web Development Course folder in this repository.

### Day 14: January 17, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Not a lot of time to do things today, and just managed to finish another Leetcode problem and get started on the first two parts of the next section of the Web Development course.

**Thoughts**: Today was a slow day, as was expected!

**Link to work**: In the Leetcode folder in this repository.

### Day 15: January 18, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did a decent amount today, including another two problems of Project Euler, and two Leetcode problems, including one medium problem!

**Thoughts**: Today was a good day, and I'm still at a better than a problem a day rate for Project Euler!

**Link to work**: In the Project Euler and Leetcode folders in this repository. 

### Day 16: January 19, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Did another problem of Project Euler.

**Thoughts**: This weekend has been fantastic, but back on the grind starting on Tuesday!
